My goal will be to create a simple Remote Access Trojan (RAT) starting from an extremely basic command line operator, and adding new features as i go.

The basic version of the program contains, on the host side, a program to create a socket that can send commands and receive response after binding to the client.
The client side of the malware will open a socket connection, receive a command, and return the responses to the server ip

Features to add:
-Keylogger
-hide the virus
