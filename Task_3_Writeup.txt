My goal will be to create a simple Remote Access Trojan (RAT) starting from a basic command line operator.
I will add more features as i continue.

The basic version of the program contains, on the host side, a program to create a socket that can send commands and receive response after binding to the client.
It creates a socket, using an unpriveliged port and the host as 0.0.0.0 to listen on all channels.
Commands are given using a loop. if the command is exit, the loop breaks and both server and client sockets are closed.
otherwise, the command is encoded and sent to the client, then their response is received and printed.

The client side of the malware will open a socket connection to the servers ip, in this case my own ip address.
It will use a loop to receive a command. subprocess library will be used to retrieve output.
The client socket will then return the responses to the server ip. If the command is exit, the loop breaks and socket is closed.

Features to add:
-Keylogger
adding keylogger as a separate file. will merge it with main soruce code after testing and debugging on virtual machine
-hide the virus
